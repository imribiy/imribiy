XOS is a customized Windows project that I created and used myself towards the end of 2020, shared it with my cousin and a few friends in my close circle, and after they liked it very much, I started to distribute it by setting up a Discord server.
Then I shared this project as open source on github for a while, but I pulled the project from github due to plagiarism in the tweaking community. Now it's continuing as semi open source.
You can check XOS at https://discord.gg/XTYEjZNPgX.

**Please check the functions and features that the project doesn't support before downloading.**
