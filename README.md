------------

XOS is a custom iso project that got rid of telemetry and useless components that come with Windows. With this method, it provides the players with the maximum performance and low latency that they can get from their computers with the automatic tweaking script included.
Since it is open source, you can use XOS with peace of mind.

**Please check the functions and features that the project doesn't support before downloading.**

> Footnote: I haven't been providing support for the XOS project since November 2021. These ISOs are files that I have prepared completely in line with my own needs and that I have sharing them with you. Please don't contact me for support. Always have the original Windows 10 image file on a USB stick as a backup.
